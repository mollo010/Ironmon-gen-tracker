# Ironmon-Tracker
This is a in developement fork of the https://github.com/besteon/Ironmon-Tracker that aims to adept the tracker to work for gen1 and gen2 games 

This project is based on [MKDasher's PokemonBizhawkLua project](https://github.com/besteon/Ironmon-Tracker).


Currently supported Pokémon games / languages:
Nothing


There are a couple of VS Code extensions which we recommend, which should automatically be recommended to you in your VS Code:

- [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig): To help with consistent formatting.
- [vscode-lua](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=trixnz.vscode-lua): Provides intellisense and linting for Lua.

Lua Versions:
- Bizhawk 2.8 uses Lua 5.1, this is the version currently set in our `.vscode/settings.json` file for linting.
- Bizhawk 2.9 and mGBA use Lua 5.4
   - Since we intend to still support Bizhawk 2.8 the code must be compatible with both Lua 5.1 and 5.4

- [mGBA Scripting API](https://mgba.io/docs/scripting.html)
